<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies.

<p>Recent studies document the need for continued decreases in harmful pesticide use and practices.
