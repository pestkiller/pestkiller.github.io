<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been efficiently utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Think about alternative methods (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Current missions for efficient, safe, and enduring pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily towards development of brand-new and better products with which to change standard hazardous pesticides.</p>
