<p>Their expert exterminators are available for 24 hr of emergency situation services for their important customers. Nevertheless, the high potential for reproduction of insect pests stays, and a population explosion of many species can be expected from a low-density level whenever suitable environmental conditions occur or control slackens. Under this plan, bug control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from regular tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>They primarily use natural techniques and pesticides that are analyzed and licensed and are protected for usage and do not possess any dangerous impacts on the environment.
