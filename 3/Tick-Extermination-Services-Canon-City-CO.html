<p>If pesticides are essential, they are selected and applied in a manner that prevents disrupting other IPM practices. Nearly every kind of pest poses a threat to the homes they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
