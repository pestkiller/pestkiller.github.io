Diseases brought on by pests are promoting the requirement for different pest control approaches such as biological, mechanical, and chemical approaches, consequently augmenting development.</p>
<p>Stored item pests are more than likely to be in a food active ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food when stored for a long period of time.
