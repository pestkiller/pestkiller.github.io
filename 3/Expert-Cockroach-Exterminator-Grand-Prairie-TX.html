Adoption of IPM can be seen under a continuum, starting with systems largely restricted to using a single tactical method such as using economic thresholds for much better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>The success of control methods should be determined using signs based on tracking of damaging organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and effect on the environment. These include the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
