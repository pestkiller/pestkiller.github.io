<p>This combination of IGRs can be reliable in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, may cause serious damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more complex tasks, are able to utilize a broader range of pesticides, and might focus on a certain location of pest control.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect types or life phases.</p>
