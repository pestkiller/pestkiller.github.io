<p>Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without triggering financial damage. Precision applications of low toxicity pesticides instead of normal baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property also have proven to significantly minimize the total volumes of pesticides applied. Insect pests frequently have natural enemies that are useful to the landscape.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and discourage pest persistence consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also consisted of to divert insect attack away from the crop. Managing pests can be performed in many ways but an efficient method is to clear out the bugs routinely. In this guide we define chemical or traditional insecticides as those having a broad spectrum of activity and being more detrimental to natural enemies.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest management (IPM) as defined by Food and Farming Company (FAO) means a pest management system in the context of associated environment and population dynamics of the pests species utilizing all appropriate technique and approaches in as suitable way as possible and maintaining pest population at levels below causing unaccepted damage or loss.</p>
