<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management methods, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, diseases, and weeds, though disputed by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest effective dose when other techniques of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
