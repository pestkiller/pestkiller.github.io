<p>Under this scheme, insect control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from periodic tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can treat a big variety of pests found in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders.
