<p>By developing an individualized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the best controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest simple. Consideration of crop plants as active components of multitrophic level interactions is essential to a total systems approach to pest management. Commercial pest control companies have obligations that go far beyond that of managing and removing pests.</p>
<p>The approach to be chosen for IPM depends on numerous elements, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial aspect of the management. Insect pests cause substantial losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural opponents or saving natural enemy populations by supplying havens or preventing practices that damage them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
