<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as a whole and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to synthetic chemicals, and have many of the human and ecological security threats as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The expert user needs to keep using pesticides and other types of intervention to levels that are required, e.g. by lowered dosages, lowered application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of danger in plant life is appropriate and they do not increase the risk for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.</p>
