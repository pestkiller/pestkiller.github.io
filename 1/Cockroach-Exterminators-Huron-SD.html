Pesticides not contained in traps or baits need to usually just be used to targeted places, not sprayed over the whole space. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach that includes the management of a pest instead of getting rid of a pest or controlling. TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl areas, and specially engineered weather removing for garage and entry doors not just deter rodents and other devastating pests from going into and living in your house, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
