<p>By finishing and using an IPM plan, members may have the ability to save cash on pest control methods which were formerly utilized and can potentially minimize future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. The majority of insecticides fall under the chemical category due to the fact that they are usually more reliable and can usually be used to control a number of pests.

Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
