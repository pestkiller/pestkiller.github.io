<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure beneficial economic condition, ecological and social effects 13 and is applicable to most farming, public health and facility pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
