SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, may cause major damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more complicated jobs, are able to use a wider series of pesticides, and might specialize in a specific location of pest control.</p>
