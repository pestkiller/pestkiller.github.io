<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Dorchester County runs a Mosquito Control Program to secure its people from the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by spraying pesticides (insecticides), applying larvicide to low-lying locations, and educating its people on minimizing the conditions that promote boosts in the mosquito population.

SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause serious damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more complicated jobs, have the ability to use a broader variety of pesticides, and may focus on a certain area of pest control.</p>

In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have failed.
