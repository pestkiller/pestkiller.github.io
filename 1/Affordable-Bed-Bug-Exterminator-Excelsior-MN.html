A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of qualified IPM experts and extension educators was an impediment for IPM application in industrialized nations.</p>
