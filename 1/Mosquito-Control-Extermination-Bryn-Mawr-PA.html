<p>Termites consume furnishings, papers, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, thus causing colossal damage within simply a few months. This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and services to inspect for insects or rodents.
