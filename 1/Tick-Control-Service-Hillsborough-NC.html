These might or might not consist of products noted on the Organic Materials Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides used in natural farming and natural gardening are typically much safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than artificial pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
