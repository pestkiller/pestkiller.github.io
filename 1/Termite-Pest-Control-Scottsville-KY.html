Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove because growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
