<p>Damage of crop residue: Pupae of bug remains inside the crop residue and can be managed by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, but artificial pesticides stay a dominant tactic in managing pests. Possibly you're the type to dive in, research your pest, check out the most effective control options, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and discourage pest determination include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very reliable in triggering considerable reductions in pest populations in specific situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or saving natural enemy populations by supplying refuges or preventing practices that damage them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
