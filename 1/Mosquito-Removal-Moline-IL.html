<p>In New York City, cockroaches are practically a lifestyle. IPM stands for integrated pest management that combines numerous tools and approaches. We have actually been in business since 1947, which means we understand the pests that are common to this area and have the knowledge and tools to eliminate them. To deplore an effective IPM program, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host range, circulation, motion, and fundamental biology will have to be looked into.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods in addition to its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the probability that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
