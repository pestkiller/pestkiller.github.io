It's possible that the duplicated usage of pesticides may be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits adjust for modifications in market prices, stage of crop development, expense of pesticides, etc., however in reality most are based on fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Regulation on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are needed to consider the principles of IPM before using chemicals.
