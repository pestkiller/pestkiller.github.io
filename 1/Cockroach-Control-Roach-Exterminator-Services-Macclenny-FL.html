Ideally, these limits adjust for modifications in market prices, stage of crop development, expense of pesticides, etc., however in reality most are based on fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Regulation on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are needed to consider the principles of IPM before using chemicals.
