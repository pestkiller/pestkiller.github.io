Pesticides load powerful and necessary punches, especially when other IPM controls fail.

<p>Sun drying: Kept grain pests can be quickly managed by sun drying. Pest control professionals or exterminators help eliminate undesirable guests from homeowners, industrial buildings, and other public areas such as mice, rats, roaches, bees, spiders, ticks, bed bugs, fleas, termites, as well as many other types of pests.

<p>The lots of varying hazards from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures.
