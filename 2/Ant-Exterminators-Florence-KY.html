Pesticides not contained in traps or baits need to usually just be used to targeted places, not sprayed over the entire space. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a viewpoint that involves the management of a pest rather of controlling or removing a pest. TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl areas, and specifically crafted weather condition stripping for garage and entry doors not only prevent rodents and other damaging pests from living and getting in in your home, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
