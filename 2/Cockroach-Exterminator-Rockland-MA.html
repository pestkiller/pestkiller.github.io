<p>In reference to the idea of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>The lots of varying hazards from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these countries, regular use of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>
<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are selected initially, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is frequently one of the most essential steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of reviewing an IPM program and the outcomes it has actually created.</p>
