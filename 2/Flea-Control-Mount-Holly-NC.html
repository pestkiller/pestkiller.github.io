If further monitoring, recognitions and action limits indicate that less dangerous controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be utilized, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. Nevertheless good the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is only fair to say that worldwide, its implementation in farming is still in its infancy, and we are a long method from understanding everything that goes on around the crops we grow for food.</p>
