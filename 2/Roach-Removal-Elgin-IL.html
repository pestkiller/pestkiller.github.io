Boron, a recognized pesticide can be fertilized into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at particular levels to attain a mechanical kill factor for self-grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more. An efficient tracking program will determine what pests are present and how they are getting in the facility, and will give insight for the development of a preventive program targeted at selected pest issues.</p>
