The understanding of various control options, pest biology and damage capacity, and suitability of readily available resources makes it possible for the grower to decide appropriate for their scenario. Greenhouses supply an ideal environment (e.g., temperature and light) for many biological control agents or natural enemies including parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>The second employee is an applicator, who uses a wide variety of pesticides and may concentrate on a particular area of pest control.
