<p>Supply food and shelter for the helpful insects (e.g., flowering plants which provide nectar). In IPM programs, growers utilize their knowledge of crop and pest biology to act that reduce the environment's suitability for pest establishment and increases in pest populations.

<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and discourage pest determination include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Problems with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or a minimum of consideration for its adoption at the local or nationwide level in the majority of nations, and in numerous it has ended up being official governmental policy. Making use of chemical representatives to handle either regular pest mitigation or more established invasions must be delegated expert pest management companies who are trained and certified in accordance with state regulations and health and safety requirements.</p>
<p>Efficient, less dangerous pest controls are picked initially, including extremely targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interfere with pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.
