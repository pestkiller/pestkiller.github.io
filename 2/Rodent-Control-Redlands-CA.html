<p>Although multiple sources specify IPM in different methods, previous models primarily focused on the ecological, and to some level on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) identified a lack of a holistic IPM method that uses both contemporary and traditional tools.</p>
<p>A smaller subset of growers use less dangerous pesticides such as scents. This can be as simple as introducing the natural predator of a particular type of pest into your environment. IPM indicates reacting to pest problems with the most effective, least-risk choice.
