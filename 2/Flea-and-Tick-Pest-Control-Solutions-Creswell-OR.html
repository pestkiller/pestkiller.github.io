Certain biostimulants based on minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stressors, however are applied as amendments with no claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new products or innovations can fall under several abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
