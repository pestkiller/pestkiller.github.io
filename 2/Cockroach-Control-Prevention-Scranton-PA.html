The chemical controls are applied only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level. Lots of individual commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in limited locations.</p>
