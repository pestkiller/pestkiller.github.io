<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is usually used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, stick around in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management program. But by concentrating on non-chemical alternatives first, you can make sure that your pest management program is successfully removing pests at the least risk to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>

Unique precautions must be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic approach to pest control.</p>
