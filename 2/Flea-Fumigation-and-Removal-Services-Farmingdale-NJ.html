<p>Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Many specific product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxins in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very reliable in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in certain circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by providing sanctuaries or avoiding practices that hurt them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of pest your operation requires to handle, having a pest management professional on your team is a reliable way to lower the risk of contamination to food. They inspect areas for proof of pests like rodents and insects consisting of ants, roaches, vermins, termites, and mosquitoes, and usually create treatment plans to avoid or eliminate pest issues.</p>
